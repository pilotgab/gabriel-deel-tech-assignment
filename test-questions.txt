Take-Home Assignment: CloudOps Engineer
Write a web application in any language that prints the
origin public IP of any request it receives in reverse:
e.g. if my ip is 1.2.3.4 it should be printed as 4.3.2.1

Bonus: store the reverse ip in a DB of your choosing.

Build a docker image of your app and a helm chart. Have a CI\CD pipeline in a platform of your choosing that builds your docker image, push to a docker registry, and deploys everything to k8s.
Please use Terraform to deploy the resources (you can signup aws and use and use the free tier or gcp and get 300$ which should be more than enough).

Please share the following with us:
Repo with app source code + helm chart + clied
yml
url to your deployed app
any other details you think may be important to your implementation
